## From the original text content, we do following steps:
<li> Tokenize -> devide the whole sentence into words in list (keep the sequence)
<li> POS Tagging -> determine a word is noun, adj or others by the word itself & sentence it's in.
<li> Named Entity Recognizer -> recognize a word/several words is name / orgnization / date and etc.
